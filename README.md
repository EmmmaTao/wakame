# Wakame
A Java port of [Nori 2](http://github.com/wjakob/nori), an education renderer by Wenzel Jakob.

Wakame was created by [Pramook Khungurn](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~pramook) and [Steve Marschner](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm).  It was used to teach [CS 6630 Realistic Image Systhesis](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs6630/2015fa) at Cornell University in the fall semester of 2015.  The programming assignments are contained in the <tt>docs</tt> directory.

This repository is the "student" version of Wakame, which means you have to complete the assignments to get it to work.  If you are an instructor of computer graphics and would like to have access to the solution, please contact the authors.

There is a Bitbucket mirror (using Mercurial) of this repository at http://bitbucket.org/pk395/wakame
