# wakame
A Java port of [Nori 2](http://github.com/wjakob/nori), an education renderer by Wenzel Jakob.

Wakame was created by [Pramook Khungurn](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~pramook) and [Steve Marschner](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm).  It was used to teach [CS 6630 Realistic Image Systhesis](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs6630/2015fa) at Cornell University in the fall semester of 2015.  The <tt>docs</tt> folder contains the programming assignments.  This repository is the "student" version of Wakame, which means you have to write the parts the assignments ask you to to make Wakame complete.  If you are an instructor of computer graphics and would like to have access to the solution, please contact the authors.
